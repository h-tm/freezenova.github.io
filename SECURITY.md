# About Fixing a file
Fixing a file makes it more accessible to be used when fetched. Found js variable `useAbsoluteLink` that helps with this.
|Last Fix | Description          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| soul essence adventure's `pre.html` | `promo.js` has resources linked incorrectly |
| soul essence adventure's `index.html`| fixed up to line `22`, need to fix `promo.js` mentioned in `pre.html` mentioned in `game.js` |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I relplace each short url with a longer version for each file

I have started working on `index.html` of **soul essence adventure**, and all of its mentioned filenames.
Oh no! how do I link to iframes?
