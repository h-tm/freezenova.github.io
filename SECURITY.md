# About Fixing a file
Fixing a file makes it more accessible to be used when fetched.
|Last Fix | Description          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| soul essence adventure's `styles.css` | fixed up to line `âˆž`, all files fixed |
| soul essence adventure's `index.html`| fixed up to line `10`, last file was `styles.css` |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I relplace each short url with a longer version for each file

I have started working on `index.html` of **soul essence adventure**, and all of its mentioned filenames.
